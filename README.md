## What is this project?

This is a test assignment for ATG and was bootstrapped with [Create React
App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br />
I took it as a chance to toy around with some cool coloring & shadow tools I've found online.
<br />
I did not want to spend too much time on this assignment so I
apologize for the wonky design. :)

## Some commands:

> ### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

> ### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
Due to being bootstrapped with the Create-react-app command this project uses
the 'react-testing-library' which I'm not very familiar with. <br />
It seems to mostly concern itself with DOM/UI testing. I'm a bit confused by its
approach, honestly.

> ### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
